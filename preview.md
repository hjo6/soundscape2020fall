In this preview, I've arranged the first 26 seconds of audio to reflect the sounds of my room from the perspective of my cat. The most notable sound in the beginning is probably the typing which is panned to the left to reflect where my desk is in relation to where my cat sleeps. In the background, you can hear the droning of the fan to the right side and behind is the sound of the washing machine. After a few seconds, the sound of my cat scratching on his scratching post comes in front and center, followed by his playing with his ball in a tunnel toy. The sound clip ends with me sighing, and will pick up with me calling my cat over and feeding him. I still need to add the sounds of him jumping down from his cat tree to scratch his scratching post, but I couldn't record good audio of him jumping down nor could I find anything that I felt fit that sound best. I plan on having him move into the upstairs afterwards and getting those sounds recorded over the weekend. Currently, my plan is to record sounds of cooking in the kitchen and I want to find an asset for either background television noise or video game noises so that it sounds like someone is doing something in the living room as well. As for the subject, I want Fig to move from my room up into the kitchen, where he'll either jump on the kitchen counter or table and then getting yelled at and chased into the living room by our other cat. I want to try to capture some form of excitement and chaos in the seemingly mundane life of a cat, since it always seems like my cat is up to no good!
